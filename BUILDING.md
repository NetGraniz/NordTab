# Building NordTab

The supported release build uses Maven 3.9+ and JDK 25 on Windows, Linux or macOS.
Set JAVA_HOME to your own JDK 25 installation and put Maven on PATH. No live server
folder, private configuration, prebuilt old plugin, or machine-specific path is required.

## Build and tests

From this project's root, run `mvn clean verify`, or on PowerShell run
`./build.ps1`. The wrapper accepts `-MavenCommand /path/to/mvn`.
The JAR is `target/NordTab-1.1.0.jar`, the same build for Paper and Folia.
Automated tests check immutable configuration snapshots and update intervals.
A successful build alone does not verify player behaviour on a live server.


Only plugin metadata resources are filtered for the release version. Configuration
templates are copied unchanged. API libraries are provided by Paper and
are not bundled. Builds pin Paper API 26.2 build 129 or the timestamped Velocity
4.2.1 API snapshot rather than depending on a live server's library directory.
This branch requires JDK 25 and targets both Paper 26.2 and Folia 26.2.

The older README and test-support fixtures may describe historical local
integration environments. BUILDING.md and pom.xml define the release build;
test-support is not packaged in the plugin JAR.

## Server settings

Install the JAR on a stopped server, start it to create its default files, then
configure your own server values. Do not publish installed config files or player
stores. Existing configuration must be backed up and reviewed before updating.
No deployment or server configuration change is performed by the build.
